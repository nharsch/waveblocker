Sing colors

A little paint app where the user changes colors by singing.
Pitch changes change color, volume changes brightness.
Uses Web Audio APIs, ml5.js, p5.js with Clojurescript.

Built as an experiment to learn some clojurescript and play with webaudio.
Pitch changes are wrapped by octaves, so C0, C1, C2, etc should produce the same color value.
